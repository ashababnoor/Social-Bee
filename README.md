Project Name	: SocialBee

Project Description: This project is a micro-blogging platform. It is sort of like a simplified version of the popular micro-blogging platforms Twitter and Instagram.
Here, you can create accounts where you can share status updates and/or upload photos and message your friends/followers.

Features Description: As it is a simplified micro-blogging platform, the features are as follows:
1.	You can create accounts and log-in to your account.
2.	You can post status updates and/or upload photos to your timeline/feed.
3.	Instant messaging with your friends/followers with at least the basic chat features. 
(this project will include a GUI interface, Java Thread and Socket)

Usefulness/Motivation: Today we live in an age where social media has become a huge part of our lives. It is what keeps us connected from far and wide. Especially during this pandemic, various social media platforms have impacted our lives massively and helped us bridge the gap of not being there physically.

Social media will continue to be a big part of our lives in the coming years. So, I thought it would be a good experience to undergo how a social media/micro-blogging platform is made and experience it first-hand through a project.

While it is certainly an ambitious project to say the very least, I believe it can help me learn a lot and brush up my coding skills as well as help me understand how to code/create projects with scale in mind. That is why I’ve chosen this to be my project.
